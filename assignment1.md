Question 1
==========
Pairs
-----
I plan on following the pairs example in class and building my implementation off of that. So I will use n^2 maps where n is the number of unique words in the file. 
The input records will be each line in the file. The intermediate key-value pairs will be the same as the final output records.
As suggested in the assignment, the final output will be a co-occurring pair and the value will be a pair with PMI and co-occurrence count.

Stripes
-------
Much like the pairs problem, I will follow the example in class and build my implementation from there. I will use n maps where n is the number of unique words in the file.
The input records will be each line in the file. The intermediate key-value pairs will have the keys as words and the values as pairs of PMIs and co-occurrence counts.
